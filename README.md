Vision of the future

- Standard journal paper
- Interactive plots
- Download the data
- Too many n=1 papers
- Too much data horded and only used once.
- Software and data have a magic property: infinitely copiable with virtually
  zero cost per copy.
- Stand on the shoulders of giants
- We spend gobs of time getting results and once we get the result we make a
  plot an all the work we've done is lost. No one can actually build upon it.
- Show software used to extract data from publication plots.

What is reproducibility?

- Show stats of how many psy expriments can't be reproduced.
- Show stats on how many computer code with papers can acutally be run.
- OS vm image with working software.
- cite the greg wilson paper in plos biology:

Why is computational reproducibilty important?

What we need

- Data must be shared and machine readable
- Source code must be shared and reproducible, open source ensures that others
  can run it.

Open Source Software

- No vendor lock in

Open Data

- CC0: Can data be copyrighted? Isn't it just fact?

How do we do this?

- data: figshare, zenodo, dryad, genbank
- source code: github, bitbucket
- create libraries instead of scripts

Python

- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pandas
- SymPy
- IPython
- Spyder
- Dexy

R

- statistics, machine learning, "machine learning is rebranded stats"
- ggplot
- weaving R code with text (knitr)

Julia

- Speed comparisons

Octave/Scilab

- Matlab clone
- xcos: simulink clone

Modelica

GSL
